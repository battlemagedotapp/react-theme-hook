# react-theme-hook

A tiny React theme provider hook/package.

Install from GitHub:

```bash
npm install github:battlemagedotapp/react-theme-hook
# or
npm install git+https://github.com/battlemagedotapp/react-theme-hook.git
```

Notes:

- This package builds on `prepare`, so `dist` is generated on install from git.
- Use `npm run build` locally to build before pushing if you prefer committing `dist/`.
